---
Project Purpose
---
The following project consisted of cleaning the Amazon Sales Report dataset in Microsft SQL Server and consequently, with the data clean, analyzing the data to find valuable insights into the history of a number of Amazon orders of clothing items in India. Additionally, this project aims to demonstrate and show the new skills learned and to apply those skills in the data analysis process.

Goal
---
To find valuable insights into Indians' shopping behaviors, especially in the northern region of the country. This could give Amazon valuable information on what can be expected in the upcoming months.  

Deliverable
---
A Tableau dashboard that provides a series of graphs, tables, and maps with key insights that tell a narrative of a broad panorama of Amazon customers in India. 

Results
---
The results showed that states such as Delhi and Rajasthan had the highest number of orders from the data analyzed. Additionally, Delhi was the region where more clothing items were shipped, having a higher total of items shipped than the total of the other northern states combined.
Amazon can expect to continue having a high demand in regions such as Dehli, Rajasthan, and Punjab. However, its sales might be below the highest point reached in April 2022. Another important finding was that in item categories, the "set" was the number 1 item order, indicating its high popularity among customers.
